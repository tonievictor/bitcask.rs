# kvuno
This is a basic implementation of a key-value store in Rust using `std::collections::HashMap`. It provides simple methods to set, get, and remove key-value pairs.

## Development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tonievictor/distributed.systems.git distsys
cd distsys/kvuno
cargo test
```
> This is just an attempt, I don't expect it to be used for anything beyond experimentations.
